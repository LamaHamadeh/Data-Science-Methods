# Computational Methods for Data Science

This repository contains lectures notes and the associated MATLAB code for the course "Computational Methods for Data Science". Lectures are primarily based upon chapters 13-20 of [Data-driven modeling & scientific computations](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Driven-Modeling-Scientific-Computation-Methods/dp/0199660344) by J. Nathan Kutz.

**Course description:** Exploratory and objective data analysis methods applied to the physical, engineering, and biological sciences. Brief review of statistical methods and their computational implementation for studying time series analysis, spectral analysis, filtering methods, principal component analysis, orthogonal mode decomposition, and image processing and compression.
